## NocoDB Extensions

NocoDB extensions are a way to extend the functionality of NocoDB. Extensions can be used to add new features or integrate with third-party services. Extensions can be built using Javascript & Vue.js.

## Getting Started

In order to get started with building extensions for NocoDB, you need to have a local development environment setup. You can follow the [Development Setup](/engineering/development-setup) guide to setup a local development environment. Once you have your development environment setup, you can start building a new extension.

## Creating a New Extension

Extensions are frontend components that are loaded into NocoDB. You can create a new extension by creating a new folder inside the `packages/nc-gui/extensions` directory. The folder should contain a `manifest.json` file that describes the extension and stores all the metadata about the extension and a index.vue file that contains the Vue component for the extension.

A sample `manifest.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "nc-json-exporter",
  "title": "JSON Exporter",
  "description": "This is a sample NocoDB extension that exports data in JSON format. \nIt is used to demonstrate how to create a NocoDB extension.\n\nThis extension is disabled by default. To access it you need to first change the `disabled` property in the manifest file to `false`.",
  "entry": "json-exporter",
  "version": "0.1",
  "iconUrl": "json-exporter/icon.png",
  "publisherName": "NocoDB",
  "publisherEmail": "contact@nocodb.com",
  "publisherUrl": "https://www.nocodb.com"
}

```

The `manifest.json` file contains the following properties:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the extension.
- `title`: The title of the extension.
- `description`: A brief description of the extension.
- `entry`: The entry point for the extension. This is the name of the folder you create inside the `extensions` directory.
- `version`: The version of the extension.
- `iconUrl`: The URL of the icon for the extension.
- `publisherName`: The name of the publisher of the extension.
- `publisherEmail`: The email of the publisher of the extension.
- `publisherUrl`: The URL of the publisher of the extension.

The `index.vue` file contains the Vue component for the extension. You can use this file to define the UI for the extension and add any functionality you need. You can also use any of our components from the NocoDB UI.

## Building the Extension

This file is just like a normal Vue component file. You can define the template, script, and style sections in this file. We provide a helper state that you can use to interact with the NocoDB API, use extension state and to get access to various helper functions. In order to use the helper state, you need to call it like this:

```javascript

const { extension, tables, getData, $api } = useExtensionHelperOrThrow()
  
```

These are available properties in the helper state:
- fullscreen - A boolean value that indicates whether the extension is in fullscreen mode or not.
- collapsed - A boolean value that indicates whether the extension is collapsed or not.
- extension - The extension object that contains the metadata for the extension.
- tables - An array of table objects in the active base
- getViewsForTable(tableId) - A function that returns an array of views for a given table.
- getData(params: {
    tableId: string
    viewId?: string
    eachPage: (records: Record<string, any>[], nextPage: () => void) => Promise<void> | void
    done: () => Promise<void> | void
  }) - A helper function for fetching all the data for a table or a view.
- getTableMeta(tableId) - A function that returns the metadata for a table.
- $api - An instance of the NocoDB API client that you can use to interact with the NocoDB API.
- insertData(params: { tableId: string; data: Record<string, any> })  - A helper function that inserts data into a table.
- updateData(params: { tableId: string; data: Record<string, any> }) - A helper function that updates data in a table.
- upsertData(params: { tableId: string; data: Record<string, any>; upsertField: ColumnType }) - A helper function that upserts data into a table.
- reloadData() - A helper function that triggers a reload of active view data.
- reloadMeta() - A helper function that triggers a reload of active view meta.

We also have a sample extension that you can use as a reference to build your own extensions. You can find the sample extension in the `packages/nc-gui/extensions/json-exporter` directory.

## Testing the Extension

After you have built the extension, you can test it by running NocoDB. It will automatically load the extension and you can see it in the Extensions panel. You can add the extension to your base and interact with it to test its functionality.

## Publishing the Extension

Once you have built and tested the extension, you can publish it to the NocoDB extension store. You can do this by creating a pull request to the NocoDB repository with your extension code. Once the pull request is merged, your extension will be available in the extension store for other users to install.
