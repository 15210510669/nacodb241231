## Overview

Integrations allow you to seamlessly connect NocoDB to external platforms like Databases (MySQL, PostgresQL), API sources (GitHub) Communication platforms (Slack, Discord), and more. As required, multiple instances of an integration can be added to a single project. Each instance of an integration created is referred to as a `Connection`.

Once connected, you can use the data from these integrations in your NocoDB base, and if applicable - even sync changes made in NocoDB back to the external platform.

Activities related to integrations & subsequent connections can be managed from `Integrations` menu easily accessible in left sidebar.
