1. **Form Area** - This is the area where fields added to the form are listed. This area also acts as a preview of the form.
2. **Form Fields** - This area lists all the fields available in the table. You can drag and drop fields for re-ordering and toggle the `hide` switch to remove fields from the form.
3. **Appearance Settings** - This is the area where you can configure the form view appearance settings like Background Color, Banner & Branding.
4. **Post Form Submission Settings** - This is the area where you can configure the form view to perform various actions after a form is submitted.
